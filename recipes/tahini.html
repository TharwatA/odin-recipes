    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The homemade tahini recipe is easy to make!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly, until the seeds become fragrant and turn light golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Stay close and keep stirring, as the seeds can burn quickly.</li>
        <li>Add the toasted sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor, then process until a crumbly paste, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple of times.</li>
        <li>Check the tahinis consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty, and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute and add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of oil.</li>
        <li>Taste the tahini for seasoning, then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix.</li>
        <li>Store tahini in an airtight container in the fridge for one month.</li>
    </ol>
