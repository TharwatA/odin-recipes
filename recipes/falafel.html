    <p>Tasty falafels!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Garlic and fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Dried spices</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak your chickpeas. Add dried chickpeas to a bowl, cover with several inches of water, and leave it overnight. They will triple in size and be ready in the morning.</li>
        <li>The next day, you will toss the soaked chickpeas and other falafel ingredients into a food processor and pulse until the mixture is chopped small, stopping before it purees into a paste.</li>
        <li>Chill the mixture for 15 minutes, then form into balls. I usually get around 18 falafel balls from this recipe. You can chill again or move on to cooking them.</li>
        <li>For the crispiest, most authentic falafel, fry them in oil.</li>
    </ol>
